# SQL/Python Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document details the **SQL/Python pipeline** implementation for customer churn prediction, demonstrating the data extraction and feature engineering process mentioned in the resume.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Database Schema

```sql
-- Customer table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    join_date DATE,
    plan VARCHAR(50),
    country VARCHAR(50),
    industry VARCHAR(50),
    monthly_revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
    monthly_logins INTEGER,
    features_used INTEGER,
    data_usage_gb DECIMAL(10,2),
    support_tickets INTEGER,
    avg_response_time_hours DECIMAL(10,2),
    satisfaction_score INTEGER,
    payment_method VARCHAR(50),
    late_payments INTEGER,
    churned BOOLEAN,
    churn_date DATE,
    churn_score DECIMAL(5,2)
);

-- Usage data table
CREATE TABLE usage_data (
    customer_id INTEGER,
    usage_date DATE,
    daily_logins INTEGER,
    session_duration_minutes INTEGER,

    # Step 1: Data Extraction
    print("📊 Extracting data from database...")
    featured_data = create_feature_dataset()
    
    # Step 2: Feature Engineering
    print("🔧 Engineering features...")
    engineered_data = engineer_features(featured_data)
